Jeyes (Java Xeyes) Project README File

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the README file for the devdaily.com Jeyes
(Java Xeyes) project.

This application is like the old X-Windows Xeyes
application, except it's written in Java instead of C.

Jeyes currently only works on the Mac OS X platform, but
it should be able to run on a Windows or Linux system
pretty easily, but I don't have those systems to test on,
so I haven't made any effort to make the code cross-platform
compatible.


DEMO
----

The best way to learn about Jeyes is to see it in action, and
to that end, I have some screenshots and a demo video on this
page:

SOURCE CODE
-----------

The source code is admittedly pretty crappy. I just through this
together to see if I could make it work. I don't have any interest
in cleaning up the code right now, but thought I'd share it here in
case anyone wanted to see how to do things like this with the
Java Swing framework.


BULDING JEYES
-------------

If you have Java and Ant installed, you can build Jeyes. Just cd 
to the build directory, and type "ant". Or, take a look at the
build.xml file in that directory for more information.
